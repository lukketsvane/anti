## Overview

GPT Researcher is designed to conduct extensive online research, capable of producing detailed, factual, and unbiased research reports. Inspired by AutoGPT and the Plan-and-Solve paper, it aims to solve the limitations of speed and determinism in current LLMs.

## Mission

Empower individuals and organizations with accurate, unbiased, and factual information by leveraging the power of AI.

## Why Choose GPT Researcher?

- **Time-Efficient**: Manually forming objective conclusions takes time, sometimes weeks.
- **Current Information**: Traditional LLMs are often trained on outdated information and carry the risk of hallucinations.
- **Unbiased**: Solutions like ChatGPT + Web Plugin only consider limited resources, potentially leading to biased conclusions.

## Architecture

The architecture involves "planner" and "execution" agents. The planner generates research questions, and the execution agents gather relevant information, which the planner then filters and compiles into a research report.

### More Specifically

1. **Generate Research Questions**: Form an objective opinion on any given task.
2. **Trigger Crawler Agents**: For each question, an agent scrapes online resources for task-relevant information.
3. **Summarize Resources**: Summarize relevant information from scraped resources and keep track of sources.
4. **Final Report**: Filter and aggregate all summarized sources to create a comprehensive research report.
